          "記得 peter 的課程宣傳下方，很多人留言推薦他的課程十足幽默風趣。當時我不信，覺得多半是工程師自我感覺良好的宅式笑話。結果上了課後，竟然不爭氣地笑惹！他的上課方式果真十分有趣，喜歡在投影片上放入一些不是重點的重點、逼別人當眾承認一堆有愧於心的答案、三不五時慫恿同學開喉歌唱，最重要的，他總是能用一些簡單風趣的例子，讓你理解難以消化的程式概念，這點不推不行。",
          "peter 回答問題的速度也是一整個驚人，不管多晚敲他，總是能立刻給你一個滿意的答案。有次我因為出國玩樂而缺課一堂，Peter 還說，如果有需要他隨時可以幫我補上，真是人美心善良 (疑!?)",
          "如果你問我，一個沒有程式基礎，邏輯概念很差的人，來修讀彼得潘的文組生課程，究竟適不適合。我只能說，越到課程後段，吸收的速度會越來越慢，感受到的挫折也會越來越大。但是但是但是，如果每次課後都能如實練習上課所教的東西，不管多忙都花時間去完成作業。那麼當你順利寫出作業時，產生的成就感絕對會遠遠大於上課聽不懂的挫折感。而且那時，才算是把上課所學之事真真切切地吸收為己所用。",
          "最後還是要感謝 peter 帶我走進這個本以為鴨不可及的 swift 世界，讓我有機會讓不會舞動的設計元素在 IOS APP 的大平台上跳躍。推薦給所有跟我一樣邏輯概念很差，金魚系記憶力低，認為這輩子注定與程式絕緣的文組生們，勇敢踏出去，跟著小飛俠一起飛翔，收穫絕對超乎你的想像。"
